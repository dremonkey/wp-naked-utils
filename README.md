# Wordpress Plugin Naked Utils

Utility plugin for Wordpress containing reusable utility functions and classes, as well as a custom javascript/css concatenation and minification workflow. But I would like to move the javascript/css concatenation and minification functionality into a separate plugin in the future.

## Dependencies
- [Debug Bar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) - This is optional but highly recommended if you are doing any kind of development. If installed then nu_debug() will create a new "Debug" tab and output debug content there instead of to the page.
